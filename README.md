# go_learn

Welcome to **go_learn**, a repository documenting my journey into the Go programming language! This repo is a collection of my learning materials, examples, and projects as I explore Go through [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/).

---

## 📚 Learning Sources
- [**A Tour of Go**](https://tour.golang.org/): A guided introduction to Go's syntax and features.
- [**Go by Example**](https://gobyexample.com/): Practical examples showcasing key Go concepts and idioms.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure
Here's how the repository is organized:

### 1. **Basics**
This folder includes exercises and examples from **A Tour of Go** and basic concepts like:
- Variables, constants, and types
- Functions, methods, and interfaces
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- Goroutines and channels (Concurrency)

### 2. **Go by Example**
This folder contains examples inspired by **Go by Example**, including:
- File handling
- HTTP servers
- JSON encoding/decoding
- Advanced Go idioms

### 3. **Projects** -> Not done yet
Hands-on projects where I apply my Go knowledge. Some ideas include:
- **A simple web Crawler**: last project from a tour of go(done)
- **File Processor**: A tool to process and summarize large files.
- **Concurrency Playground**: Projects demonstrating Go's concurrency model.
- **more in mind**

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a solid foundation in Go programming.
- Understand and apply Go's idiomatic practices.
- Develop real-world projects to reinforce learning.
- Explore Go's concurrency model and performance benefits.
